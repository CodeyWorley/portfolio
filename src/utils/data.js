    intro: "Hi, my name is Codey and I'm a full stack JS developer and software engineer located in Phoenix Arizona. I specialize in the MERN stack and my previous experience includes building web apps with PHP, Ruby, Java, and Python.",
    closing: "When I'm not programming I like to create things with my hands like tesla coils and magnetic levitrons. I also enjoy difficult video games and going to breweries with my friends. My 5 year plan is to become a senior developer with many profitable side projects going on the side. I look forward to joining an awesome team in which I can have fun and grow as a developer!"
