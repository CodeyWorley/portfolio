// about
export const about = {
  intro: "Hi, my name is Codey and I'm a Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer located in Phoenix, Arizona. My curiosity in tech has allowed me to learn many different languages and frameworks. However I am currently looking to find a role on a team which will allow me to specialize in one specific stack on my journey to becoming a senior developer.",

  thinkful: "I have recently graduated from Thinkful's Engineering Immersion Program where I thoroughly learned the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node, React). Working with a remote team of developers I gained first hand experience with Agile methodologies and version control in a mock professional setting.",
  
  flh: "Before that I was hired on with an Amazon Prime seller to create a sales platform in PHP and Laravel. The app enabled the sales department to upload and manage products in both Amazon and Walmart in one easy-to-use location. I worked as the primary developer to create and ship a mobile-friendly product in under a year which proved to be an invaluable resource for them, reducing time spent on product management by 50% and also opening up a new market to the company.",
  
  contract: "Over the years I have also created and extended small websites for local businesses and family friends using PHP, WordPress, and vanilla HTML/CSS. One of them being southwestwaterservice.com which was created in PHP and launched in 2017 when I was still pretty new to web development. However I am currently in the process of doing a complete rework of the website in React and including an employee portal for customer management which will replace their legacy CRM.",

  closing: "When I'm not programming I like to create things with my hands like tesla coils, magnetic levitrons, and home improvement projects. I also enjoy difficult video games (Classic WoW hype) and going to breweries with my friends. My 5 year plan is to become a senior developer with many interesting side projects going on the side. I look forward to joining an awesome team in which I can meet cool new people and grow as a developer!"
